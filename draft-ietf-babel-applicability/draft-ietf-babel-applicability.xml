<t>Where we argue that, although OSPF and IS-IS are fine protocols, there
exists a space where the Babel routing protocol (RFC 6126bis) is
useful.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>Babel <xref target="RFC6126bis"/> is a routing protocol based on the
familiar distance-vector algorithm (sometimes known as distributed
Bellman-Ford) augmented with mechanisms for loop avoidance (there is no
"counting to infinity") and starvation avoidance.  In this document, we
argue that there exist niches where Babel is useful and that are not
adequately served by mature, efficient and highly refined protocols such
as OSPF <xref target="RFC5340"/> and IS-IS <xref target="RFC1195"/>.</t>

<section title="Technical overview of the Babel protocol">

<t>At its core, Babel is a traditional distance-vector protocol based on
the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm, similar in principle to RIP <xref
target="RFC2453"/>, but with two obvious extensions: provisions for
sensing of neighbour reachability, bidirectional reachability and link
quality, and support for multiple address families (e.g., IPv6 and IPv4)
in a single protocol instance.</t>

<t>Algorithms of this class are simple to understand and simple to
implement, but unfortunately they do not work very well &mdash; they
suffer from "counting to infinity", a case of pathologically slow
convergence in some topologies after link failure.  Babel uses a mechanism
pioneered by EIGRP <xref target="DUAL"/> <xref target="RFC7868"/>, known
as "feasibility", which avoids routing loops and therefore makes counting
to infinity impossible.</t>

<t>Feasibility is a very conservative mechanism, one that not only rejects
all looping routes, but also rejects some loop-free routes.  Thus, it can
lead to a situation known as "starvation", where a router rejects all
routes to a given destination, even those that are loop-free.  In order to
recover from starvation, Babel uses a mechanism pioneered by DSDV <xref
target="DSDV"/> and known as "sequenced routes".  In Babel, this mechanism
is generalised to deal with prefixes of arbitrary length and routes
announced at multiple points in a single routing domain (DSDV was a pure
mesh protocol, and only dealt with host routes).</t>

<t>The sequenced routes algorithm is slow to react to a starvation
episode.  In Babel, starvation recovery is accelerated by using explicit
requests (known as "seqno requests" in the protocol) that signal
a starvation episode and cause a new sequenced route to be propagated in
a timely manner.  In the absence of packet loss, this mechanism is
provably complete and clears the starvation in time proportional to the
diameter of the network, at the cost of some additional signalling
traffic.</t>

</section>

<section title="Properties of the Babel protocol">

<t>The fairly strong properties of the Babel protocol (convergence, loop
avoidance, starvation avoidance) rely on some rather weak properties of
the network and the metric being used.  The most significant are:
<list style="symbols">
<t>causality: a control message is not received before it has been sent
(more precisely, the "happens-before" relation is acyclic);</t>
<t>strict monotonicity of the metric: M&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;C&nbsp;+&nbsp;M;</t>
<t>left-distributivity of the metric: if M&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;M',
then C&nbsp;+&nbsp;M&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;C&nbsp;+&nbsp;M'.</t>
</list>
In particular, Babel does not assume a reliable transport, it does not
assume ordered delivery, it does not assume that communication is
transitive, and it does not require that the metric be discrete
(continuous metrics are possible, reflecting for example packet loss
rates).  This is in contrast to traditional link-state routing protocols
such as OSPF <xref target="RFC5340"/> or IS-IS <xref target="RFC1195"/>
which are layered over a reliable flooding algorithm and make stronger
requirements on the underlying network and metric.</t>

<section title="Simplicity and implementability">

<t>Babel is a conceptually simple protocol.  It consists of a familiar
algorithm (distributed Bellman-Ford) augmented with three simple and
well-defined mechanisms (feasibility, sequenced routes and explicit
requests).  Given a sufficiently friendly audience, the principles behind
Babel can be explained in 15 minutes, and a full description of the
protocol can be done in 52 minutes (one microcentury).</t>

<t>An important consequence is that Babel is easy to implement.  While
Babel is a young protocol, there exist four independent implementations,
including one that was reportedly written and debugged in just two nights.</t>

</section>

<section title="Robustness">

<t>Babel's correctness depends on a small number of fairly weak and
reasonably obvious properties.  This makes Babel in many ways a robust
protocol:
<list style="symbols">
<t>robust with respect to bugs: unless you are very unlucky, an
implementation bug does probably not violate the properties on which Babel
relies; in our (extensive) experience, implementation bugs tend to slow
down convergence or cause sub-optimal routing, but do not cause the
network to collapse;</t>
<t>robust with respect to unusual networks: an unusual network
(non-transitive links, unstable links, etc.) does most probably not
violate the assumptions of the protocol;</t>
<t>robust with respect to novel metrics: no matter how strange your
metric (continuous, constantly fluctuating, etc.), it does most probably
not violate the assumptions of the protocol.</t>
</list></t>

<t>These robustness properties have important consequences for the
applicability of the protocol: Babel works (more or less efficiently) in
a wide range of circumstances where traditional routing protocols give up.</t>

</section>

<section title="Extensibility">

<t>Babel's packet format has a number of features designed to make the
protocol extensible, and a number of extensions have been designed to make
Babel work better in situations that were not envisioned when the protocol
was initially designed.  This extensibility is not an accident, but
a consequence of the design of the protocol: it is easy to check whether
a given extension violates the assumptions made by the protocol.</t>

<t>Remarkably enough, all of the extensions designed to date interoperate
with the base protocol and with each other.  This, again, is a consequence
of the protocol design: in order to check the interoperability of two
implementations of Babel, it is enough to verify that the interaction of
the two does not violate the protocol's assumptions.</t>

<t>Notable extensions deployed to date include:
<list style="symbols">
<t>source-specific routing (SADR) <xref target="BABEL-SS"/>, which
allows routing to take a packet's source address into account, thus
enabling a cheap form of multihoming <xref target="SS-ROUTING"/>;</t>
<t>RTT-based routing <xref target="BABEL-RTT"/>, which allows routing to
minimise link delay, which is useful in overlay network (where both hop
count and packet loss are poor metrics).</t>
</list>
Some other extensions have been designed, but have not seen deployment
yet (and their usefulness is yet to be demonstrated):
<list style="symbols">
<t>frequency-aware routing <xref target="BABEL-Z"/>, which allows routing
to minimise radio interference in wireless networks;</t>
<t>ToS-aware routing <xref target="BABEL-TOS"/>, which allows routing
to take a packet's ToS marking into account for selected routes without
incurring the full cost of a multi-topology routing protocol.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Limitations">

<t>Babel has some undesirable properties that make it suboptimal or even
unusable in some deployments.</t>

<section title="Periodic updates">

<t>The main mechanisms used by Babel to reconverge after a topology change
are reactive: triggered updates, triggered retractions and explicit
requests.  However, in the presence of heavy packet loss, Babel relies on
periodic updates to clear pathologies.  This reliance on periodic updates
makes Babel unsuitable in at least two kinds of deployments:
<list style="symbols">
<t>large, stable networks: since Babel sends periodic updates even in the
absence of topology changes, in well-managed, large, stable networks the
amount of control traffic will be reduced by using a protocol that relies
on a reliable transport (such as OSPF, IS-IS or EIGRP);</t>
<t>low-power networks: the periodic updates use up battery power even when
there are no topology changes and no user traffic, which makes Babel
undesirable in stable, low-power networks.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Full routing table">

<t>While there exist techniques that allow a Babel speaker to function
with a partial routing table (e.g., by using just a default route), the
basic design of the protocol is that every Babel speaker has a full
routing table.  In networks where some nodes are too constrained to hold
a full routing table, it might be preferable to use a protocol designed to
function with a partial routing table (such as AODVv2 <xref
target="AODVv2"/>, RPL <xref target="RFC6550"/> or LOADng <xref
target="LOADng"/>).</t>

</section>

<section title="Slow aggregation">

<t>Babel's loop-avoidance mechanism relies on making a route unreachable
after a retraction until all neighbours have been guaranteed to have acted
upon the retraction, even in the presence of packet loss.  Unless the
optional algorithm described in Section 3.5.5 of <xref target="RFC6126bis"/>
is implemented, this entails that a node is unreachable for a few
minutes after the most specific route to it has been retracted.  This
property may make Babel undesirable in networks that perform automatic
aggregation.</t>

</section>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Existing successful deployments of Babel"
         anchor="existing">

<t>In this section, we give a few examples of environments where Babel has
been successfully deployed.</t>

<section title="Hybrid networks">

<t>Babel is able to deal with both classical, prefix-based
("Internet-style") routing and flat ("mesh-style") routing over
non-transitive link technologies.  Because of that, it has seen a number
of succesful deployments in medium-sized hybrid networks, networks that
combine a wired, aggregated backbone with meshy wireless bits at the edges.
No other routing protocol known to us is similarly robust and efficient in
this particular type of network.</t>

</section>
<section title="Large scale overlay networks">

<t>The algorithms used by Babel (loop avoidance, hysteresis, delayed
updates) allow it to remain stable and efficient in the presence of
unstable metrics, even in the presence of a feedback loop.  For this
reason, it has been successfully deployed in large scale overlay networks,
built out of thousands of tunnels spanning continents, where it is used
with a metric computed from links' latencies.</t>

<t>This particular application depends on the extension for RTT-sensitive
routing <xref target="DELAY-BASED"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Pure mesh networks">

<t>While Babel is a general-purpose routing protocol, it has been
repeatedly shown to be competitive with dedicated routing protocols for
wireless mesh networks <xref target="REAL-WORLD"/> <xref
target="BRIDGING-LAYERS"/>.  Although this particular niche is already
served by a number of mature protocols, notably OLSR-ETX and OLSRv2 <xref
target="RFC7181"/> (equipped e.g.&nbsp;with the DAT metric <xref
target="RFC7779"/>), Babel has seen a moderate amount of successful
deployment in pure mesh networks.</t>

</section>

<section title="Small unmanaged networks">

<t>Because of its small size and simple configuration, Babel has been
deployed in small, unmanaged networks (three to five routers), where it
serves as a more efficient replacement for RIP <xref target="RFC2453"/>,
over which it has two significant advantages: the ability to route
multiple address families (IPv6 and IPv4) in a single protocol instance,
and good support for using wireless links for transit.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This document requires no IANA actions.  [RFC Editor: please remove this
section before publication.]</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>As is the case in all distance-vector routing protocols, a Babel
speaker receives reachability information from its neighbours, which by
default is trusted.  A number of attacks are possible if this information
is not suitably protected, either by a lower-layer mechanism or by an
extension to the protocol itself (e.g.&nbsp;<xref target="RFC7298"/>).</t>

<t>Implementors and deployers must be aware of the insecure nature of the
base protocol, and must take suitable measures to ensure that the protocol
is deployed as securely as required by the application.</t>
