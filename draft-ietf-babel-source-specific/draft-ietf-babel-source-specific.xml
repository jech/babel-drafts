<abstract>
<t>Source-specific routing (also known as Source-Address Dependent
Routing, SADR) is an extension to traditional next-hop routing where
packets are forwarded according to both their destination and their source
address.  This document describes an extension for source-specific routing
to the Babel routing protocol.</t>
</abstract>

<section title="Introduction and background">

<t>The Babel routing protocol <xref target="BABEL"/> is a distance vector
routing protocol for next-hop routing.  In next-hop routing, each node
maintains a forwarding table which maps destination prefixes to next hops.
The forwarding decision is a per-packet operation which depends on the
destination address of the packets and on the entries of the forwarding
table.  When a packet is about to be routed, its destination address is
compared to the prefixes of the routing table: the entry with the most
specific prefix containing the destination address of the packet is
chosen, and the packet is forwarded to the associated next-hop.  Next-hop
routing is a simple, well understood paradigm that works satisfactorily in
a large number of cases.</t>

<t>Source-specific routing <xref target="SS-ROUTING"/>, or Source Address
Dependent Routing (SADR) <xref target="DSR"/>, is a modest extension to
next-hop routing where the forwarding decision depends not only on the
destination address but also on the source address of the packet being
routed, which makes it possible for two packets with the same destination
but different source addresses to be routed following different paths.
The forwarding tables are extended to map pairs of prefixes (destination,
source) to next hops.  When multiple entries match a given packet, the one
with the most specific destination prefix is chosen, and, in case of
equality, the one with the most specific source prefix.</t>

<t>The main application of source-specific routing is a form of
multihoming known as multihoming with multiple addresses.  When using this
technique in a network connected to multiple providers, every host is
assigned multiple addresses, one per provider.  When a host sources
a packet, it picks one of its addresses as the source address, and
source-specific routing is used to route the packet to an edge router that
is connected to the corresponding provider, which is compatible with <xref
target="BCP84"/>.  Unlike classical multihoming, this technique is
applicable to small networks, as it does not require the use of
provider-independent addresses, or cause excessive growth of the global
routing table.  More details are given in <xref target="SS-ROUTING"/> and
<xref target="DSR"/>.</t>

<t>This document describes a source-specific routing extension for the
Babel routing protocol <xref target="BABEL"/>.  This involves minor
changes to the data structures, which must include a source prefix in
addition to the destination prefix already present, and some changes to
the Update, Route Request and Seqno Request TLVs, which are extended with
a source prefix.  The source prefix is encoded using a mandatory sub-TLV
(<xref target="BABEL"/> Section 4.4).</t>

</section>

<section title="Specification of Requirements">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Data Structures">

<t>A number of the conceptual data structures described in Section 3.2 of
<xref target="BABEL"/> contain a destination prefix.  This specification
extends these data structures with a source prefix.  Data from the
original protocol, which do not specify a source prefix, are stored with
a zero length source prefix, which matches exactly the same set of packets
as the original, non-source-specific data.</t>

<section title="The Source Table">

<t>Every Babel node maintains a source table, as described in <xref
target="BABEL"/> Section&nbsp;3.2.5.  A source-specific Babel node
extends this table with the following field:</t>
<t><list style="symbols">
<t>The source prefix specifying the source address of packets to which
this entry applies.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The source table is now indexed by triples of the form (prefix, source
prefix, router-id).</t>

<t>Note that the route entry contains a source which itself contains
a source prefix.  These are two very different concepts that should not be
confused.</t>

</section>

<section title="The Route Table">

<t>Every Babel node maintains a route table, as described in <xref
target="BABEL"/> Section&nbsp;3.2.6.  Each route table entry contains,
among other data, a source, which this specification extends with a source
prefix as described above.  The route table is now indexed by triples of
the form (prefix, source prefix, neighbour), where the prefix and source
prefix are obtained from the source.</t>

</section>

<section title="The Table of Pending Seqno Requests">

<t>Every Babel node maintains a table of pending seqno requests, as
described in <xref target="BABEL"/>, Section&nbsp;3.2.7.  A
source-specific Babel node extends this table with the following entry:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
<t>The source prefix being requested.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The table of pending seqno requests is now indexed by triples of the
form (prefix, source prefix, router-id).</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Data Forwarding">

<t>In next-hop routing, if two routing table entries overlap, then one is
necessarily more specific than the other; the "longest prefix rule"
specifies that the most specific applicable routing table entry is
chosen.</t>

<t>With source-specific routing, there might no longer be a most specific
applicable entry: two routing table entries might match a given packet
without one necessarily being more specific than the other.  Consider for
example the following routing table:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
          destination                source     next-hop
    2001:DB8:0:1::/64                  ::/0            A
                 ::/0     2001:DB8:0:2::/64            B
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>This specifies that all packets with destination in 2001:DB8:0:1::/64
are to be routed through A, while all packets with source in
2001:DB8:0:2::/64 are to be routed through B.  A packet with source
2001:DB8:0:2::42 and destination 2001:DB8:0:1::57 matches both rules,
although neither is more specific than the other.  A choice is necessary,
and unless the choice being made is the same on all routers in a routing
domain, persistent routing loops may occur.  More details are
given in <xref target="SS-ROUTING"/> Section IV.C.</t>

<t>A Babel implementation MUST choose routing table entries by using the
so-called destination-first ordering, where a routing table entry R1 is
preferred to a routing table entry R2 when either R1's destination prefix
is more specific than R2's, or the destination prefixes are equal and R1's
source prefix is more specific than R2's.  (In more formal terms, routing
table entries are compared using the lexicographic product of the
destination prefix ordering by the source prefix ordering.)  This is
consistent with the behaviour described in Section 3.3 of
<xref target="DSR"/>.</t>

<t>In practice, this means that a source-specific Babel implementation
must take care that any lower layer that performs packet forwarding obey
this semantics.  In particular:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
<t>If the lower layers implement the destination-first ordering, then the
Babel implementation MAY use them directly;</t>
<t>If the lower layers can hold source-specific routes, but not with the
right semantics, then the Babel implementation MUST disambiguate the
routing table by using a suitable disambiguation algorithm (see <xref
target="SS-ROUTING"/> Section V.B for such an algorithm);</t>
<t>If the lower layers cannot hold source-specific routes, then a Babel
implementation MUST silently ignore (drop) any source-specific routes.</t>
</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Protocol Operation">

<t>This extension does not fundamentally change the operation of the Babel
protocol, and we therefore only describe differences between the original
protocol and the extended protocol.</t>

<t>In the original protocol, three TLVs carry a destination prefix:
Updates, Route Requests and Seqno Requests.  This specification extends
these messages to optionally carry a source prefix sub-TLV, as described
in <xref target="protocol-encoding"/> below.  The sub-TLV is marked as
mandatory, so that an unextended implementation will silently ignore the
whole enclising TLV.  A node obeying this specification MUST NOT send
a TLV with a zero-length source prefix: instead, it sends a TLV with no
source prefix sub-TLV.  Conversely, an extended implementation MUST
interpret an unextended TLV as carrying a source prefix of zero length.
Taken together, these properties ensure interoperability between the
original and extended protocols (see <xref target="compatibility"/>
below).</t>

<section title="Protocol Messages">

<t>This extension allows three TLVs of the original Babel protocol to
carry a source prefix: Update TLVs, Route Request TLVs and Seqno Request
TLVs.</t>

<t>In order to advertise a route with a non-zero-length source prefix,
a node sends a source-specific Update, i.e., an Update with a source
prefix sub-TLV.  When a node receives a source-specific Update (prefix,
source prefix, router-id, seqno, metric) from a neighbour neigh, it
behaves as described in <xref target="BABEL"/> Section&nbsp;3.5.4, except
that the entry under consideration is indexed by (prefix, source prefix,
neigh) rather than just (prefix, neigh).</t>

<t>Similarly, when a node needs to send a Request of either kind that
applies to a route with a non-zero length source prefix, it sends
a source-specific Request, i.e., a Request with a source prefix sub-TLV.
When a node receives a source-specific Request, it behaves as described in
Section 3.8 of <xref target="BABEL"/>, except that the request applies to
the Route Table entry carrying the source prefix indicated by the
sub-TLV.</t>

</section>

<section title="Wildcard Messages">

<t>In the original protocol, the Address Encoding value 0 is used for
wildcard messages: messages that apply to all routes, of any address
family and with any destination prefix.  Wildcard messages are allowed
in two places in the protocol: wildcard retractions are used to retract
all of the routes previously advertised by a node on a given interface,
and wildcard Route Requests are used to request a full dump of the Route
Table from a given node.  Wildcard messages are intended to apply to all
routes, including routes decorated with additional data and AE values to
be defined by future extensions, and hence this specification extends
wildcard operations to apply to all routes, whatever the value of the
source prefix.</t>

<t>More precisely, a node receiving an Update with the AE field set to
0 and the Metric field set to infinity (a wildcard retraction) MUST apply
the route acquisition procedure described in Section 3.5.4 of <xref
target="BABEL"/> to all of the routes that is has learned from the sending
node, whatever the value of the source prefix.  A node MUST NOT send
a wildcard retraction with an attached source prefix, and a node that
receives a wildcard retraction with a source prefix MUST silently ignore
it.</t>

<t>Similarly, a node that receives a route request with the AE field set
to 0 (a wildcard route request) SHOULD send a full routing table dump,
including routes with a non-zero-length source prefix.  A node MUST NOT
send a wildcard request that carries a source prefix, and a node receiving
a wildcard request with a with a source prefix MUST silently ignore
it.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Compatibility with the base protocol" anchor="compatibility">

<t>The protocol extension defined in this document is, to a great extent,
interoperable with the base protocol defined in <xref target="BABEL"/>
(and all of its extensions).  More precisely, if non-source-specific
routers and source-specific routers are mixed in a single routing domain,
Babel's loop-avoidance properties are preserved, and, in particular, no
persistent routing loops will occur.</t>

<t>However, this extension is encoded using mandatory sub-TLVs, introduced
in <xref target="BABEL"/>, and therefore is not compatible with the older
version of the Babel Routing Protocol <xref target="RFC6126"/>.
Consequently, this extension MUST NOT be used with routers implementing
RFC 6126, otherwise persistent routing loops may occur.</t>

<section title="Loop-avoidance" anchor="loop">

<t>The extension defined in this protocol uses a new Mandatory sub-TLV to
carry the source prefix information.  As discussed in Section&nbsp;4.4 of
<xref target="BABEL"/>, this encoding ensures that non-source-specific
routers will silently ignore the whole TLV, which is necessary to avoid
persistent routing loops in hybrid networks.</t>

<t>Consider two nodes A and B, with A source-specific announcing a route
to (D,&nbsp;S).  Suppose that B (non source-specific) merely ignores the
source prefix information when it receives the update rather than ignoring
the whole TLV, and re-announces the route as D.  This re-announcement
reaches A, which treats it as (D,&nbsp;::/0).  Packets destined to D but
not sourced in S will be forwarded by A to B, and by B to A, causing a
persistent routing loop:</t>
<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
    (D,S)                 (D)
     <--                 <--
  ------ A ----------------- B
           -->
          (D,::/0)
]]></artwork></figure>

</section>

<section title="Starvation and Blackholes">

<t>In general, discarding source-specific routes by non-source-specific
routers will cause route starvation.  Intuitively, unless there are enough
non-source-specific routes in the network, non-source-specific routers
will suffer starvation, and discard packets for destinations that are only
announced by source-specific routers.</t>

<t>A simple yet sufficient condition for avoiding starvation is to build a
connected source-specific backbone that includes all of the edge routers,
and announce a (non-source-specific) default route towards the
backbone.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Protocol Encoding" anchor="protocol-encoding">

<t>This extension defines a new sub-TLV used to carry a source prefix: the
Source Prefix sub-TLV.  It can be used within an Update, a Route Request
or a Seqno Request TLV to match a source-specific entry of the Route
Table, in conjunction with the destination prefix natively carried by
these TLVs.</t>

<t>Since a source-specific routing entry is characterized by a single
destination prefix and a single source prefix, a source-specific message
contains exactly one Source Prefix sub-TLV.  A node MUST NOT send more
that one Source Prefix sub-TLV in a TLV, and a node receiving more than
one Source Prefix sub-TLV in a single TLV SHOULD ignore this TLV.  It MAY
ignore the whole packet.</t>

<section title="Source Prefix sub-TLV">

<t>Fields:
<list style="hanging" hangIndent="10">
<t hangText="Type">Set to TBD to indicate a Source Prefix
sub-TLV.</t>
<t hangText="Length">The length of the body, exclusive of the Type and

This MUST NOT be 0.</t>
<t hangText="Source Prefix">The source prefix being advertised.  This
field's size is (Source Plen)/8 rounded upwards.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>The contents of the source prefix sub-TLV are interpreted according to
the AE of the enclosing TLV.</t>

<t>Note that this sub-TLV is a mandatory sub-TLV.  Threfore, as described
in Section 4.4 of <xref target="BABEL"/>, the whole TLV MUST be ignored if
that sub-TLV is not understood (or malformed).  Otherwise, routing loops
may occur (see <xref target="loop"/>).</t>

</section>

<section title="Source-specific Update">

<t>The source-specific Update is an Update TLV with a Source Prefix
sub-TLV.  It advertises or retracts source-specific routes in the same
manner than routes with non-source-specific Updates (see <xref
target="BABEL"/>).  A wildcard retraction (Update with AE equals to 0)
MUST NOT carry a Source Prefix sub-TLV.</t>

<t>Contrary to the destination prefix, this extension does not compress
the source prefix attached to Updates.  However, compression is allowed
for the destination prefix of source-specific routes.  As described in
Section 4.5 of <xref target="BABEL"/>, unextended implementations will
correctly update their parser state while otherwise ignoring the whole TLV.</t>

</section>

<section title="Source-specific (Route) Request" anchor="ss-request">

<t>A source-specific Route Request is a Route Request TLV with a Source
Prefix sub-TLV.  It prompts the receiver to send an update for a given
pair of destination and source prefixes, as described in Section 3.8.1.1
of <xref target="BABEL"/>.  A wildcard request (Route Request with AE
equals to 0) MUST NOT carry a Source Prefix sub-TLV.</t>

</section>

<section title="Source-Specific Seqno Request">

<t>A source-specific Seqno Request is a Seqno Request TLV with a Source
Prefix sub-TLV.  It requests the receiving node to perform the procedure
described in Section 3.8.1.2 of <xref target="BABEL"/>, but applied to
a pair of a destination and source prefix.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="IANA Considerations">

<t>IANA is requested to allocate TBD, a Babel sub-TLV type from the range
reserved for mandatory sub-TLVs [value 128 suggested], and to add the
following entry to the "Babel mandatory sub-TLV Types" registry:</t>

<texttable>
<ttcol>Type</ttcol><ttcol>Name</ttcol><ttcol>Reference</ttcol>
<c>TBD[128]</c><c>Source Prefix</c><c>(this document)</c>
</texttable>

</section>

<section title="Security considerations">

<t>The extension defined in this document adds a new sub-TLV to three TLVs
already present in the original Babel protocol, and does not in itself
change the security properties of the protocol.  However, source-specific
routing gives more control over routing to the sending hosts, which might
have security implications (see Section 8 of <xref target="DSR"/>).</t>
